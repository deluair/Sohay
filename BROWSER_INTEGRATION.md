# Browser Integration in Sohay

This document summarizes the work done to integrate browser automation capabilities into Sohay.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Updated Browser Module** (`sohay_browser.py`)
   - Fixed import issues with the browser-use library
   - Implemented more resilient error handling
   - Updated to match the latest browser-use API
   - Added better logging and debugging information

2. **Sohay Runner Updates** (`sohay_runner.py`)
   - Added more resilient browser import handling
   - Implemented a dedicated `test_browser` command
   - Enhanced error reporting for browser-related issues
   - Made the browser integration optional but easily testable

3. **Testing Tools**
   - Created `test_browser_simple.py` for direct testing of browser-use
   - Updated OpenAI API key testing scripts
   - Added detailed error messages and troubleshooting guides

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with browser setup instructions
   - Added browser-specific commands to the help system
   - Created troubleshooting guides for common issues

## How Browser Integration Works

Sohay uses the [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) library to provide browser automation capabilities. This integration:

1. Creates an AI agent powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model
2. Allows the agent to control web browsers using Playwright
3. Enables natural language commands to navigate and interact with websites
4. Provides functions for common tasks like web searching and taking screenshots

## Commands

The following browser commands are available in Sohay:

- `browser open [URL]` - Open a specific website
- `browse [URL]` - Shorthand for browser open
- `websearch [query]` - Search the web for information
- `screenshot [filename]` - Take a screenshot of the current page
- `test browser` - Run a test of the browser functionality
- `test openai` - Test if your OpenAI API key is working
- `setup openai` - Configure your OpenAI API key

## Dependencies

Browser automation requires the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install browser-use playwright langchain langchain-openai python-dotenv
python -m playwright install
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Import errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed and up to date
2. **API key issues**: Verify your OpenAI API key has access to GPT-4o-mini
3. **Browser errors**: Run `python -m playwright install` to reinstall browser drivers
4. **Permissions issues**: Ensure your system allows browser automation

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future enhancement:

1. Add support for more browser commands like filling forms and extracting data
2. Implement persistent browser sessions across commands
3. Add support for headless/visible mode selection
4. Enhance error handling and recovery for browser tasks
5. Add support for screenshots and visual verification
